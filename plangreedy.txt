Plan for Greedy Coloring Algorithm

1. Color 0th node the 0th color.
2. For remaining vertices:
   i. create temp boolean[] called available, each index corresponding to
      a color. available.size = number of neighbors???
   ii. ierate through current vertex's immediate neighbors, altering boolean
       values in available as necessary
   iii. iterate through available, assign current vertex color corresponding to
   	first 'true' in available.
