Plan for Welsh-Powell Algorithm for Graph Coloring:

1. Find degree of each vertex (size of _neighbors in Node.pde)
2. Create ArrayList of nodes in Graph s.t. they are in descending order by
   degree

First Pass: currentColor = 0th in array of colors
Start at beginning of ArrayList, color this node with currentColor, remove it.
Iterate through ArrayList. If a given node has a neighbor that's assigned
currentColor, skip it. Otherwise, color it currentColor and remove it.

Second Pass: currentColor = 1st in array of colors
Start at beginning of ArrayList (any nodes that have already been colored have
been removed). Color this node with currentColor, remove it.
... The same process, only now currentColor has been changed.

Third Pass: currentColor = 2nd in array of colors

.
.
.
And so on and so forth, until ArrayList is empty (i.e. all nodes are colored).
The nice thing about this algorithm is that by starting with the vertices with
the highest degrees, we can take care of the vertices with the highest number
of conflicts as early as possible :)
