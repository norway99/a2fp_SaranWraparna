Final Proj Plans...

First order of business -- Create graph data structure!

Node.java
- ArrayList of pointers to other Nodes
- int color (from global array of available colors)
- getColor() and setColor(int)
- getNode(int) -- returns Node at position int in the ArrayList
- setNode(int, Node)

Graph.java
- array of available colors
- addNode()
- boolean solved
- Node _root
- solve(int) -- int being the number of colors

Driver.pde
--> Click to create Node
--> Click two Nodes to create edge in between Nodes
--> Dialogue box for user to indicate whether she is creating Nodes or creating
edges, or if she's done drawing the graph

Initially, we will test our graph coloring algo by creating a program in
Processing that will allow the user to draw their own vertices and edges.

If we get to it/are able to figure this part out, we'll then figure out how to 
translate an image (white background, black borders) into a graph and then 
render it as a colored map.
